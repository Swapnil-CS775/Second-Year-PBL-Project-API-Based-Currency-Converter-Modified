# Second-Year-PBL-Project-API-Based-Currency-Converter-Modified

<h1>Title-Currency Converter</h1>
<p>
  Overview:
The Currency Converter project is a web application that enables users to convert currencies between 159 different countries. This interactive tool utilizes HTML for structuring, CSS for styling,
and JavaScript for functionality. The key concepts employed in the JavaScript code include DOM manipulation, asynchronous programming with Promises, and the use of an open-source Currency API.

<h3>Key Features:</h3>

<h5>User-Friendly Interface:</h5>
The project boasts an intuitive and user-friendly interface, allowing users to effortlessly navigate and utilize the currency conversion functionalities.

</h5>Currency Selection with Flag Display:</h5>
Users not only have the flexibility to choose the source and target currencies from a comprehensive list of 159 countries, but also experience a visual element with the display of the selected
country's flag. This engaging feature enhances the overall user experience.

<h5>Real-time Currency Rates:</h5>
The application fetches real-time currency exchange rates from an open-source Currency API. This ensures that the conversions are based on the latest market rates, providing users with accurate and
up-to-date results.

<h5>DOM Manipulation:</h5>
The Document Object Model (DOM) is leveraged to dynamically update the content on the webpage without requiring a page reload. This allows for a seamless and responsive user experience.

<h5>Asynchronous Programming:</h5>
Asynchronous JavaScript operations are implemented using Promises, ensuring that the fetching of currency exchange rates does not block the main thread. This enhances the efficiency of the application, 
preventing delays in responsiveness.

<h5>Async/Await:</h5>
The code utilizes the async/await syntax to handle asynchronous operations in a more readable and concise manner. This makes the codebase cleaner and easier to maintain, improving overall project quality.

<h5>Error Handling:</h5>
Robust error-handling mechanisms are implemented to manage potential issues such as network errors or invalid user inputs. Users are provided with clear error messages, enhancing the overall reliability of 
the application.

<h3>Technologies Used:</h3>

<h6>HTML:</h6> Used for creating the structure of the web page.
<h6>CSS:</h6> Employed for styling the interface and ensuring a visually appealing design.
<h6>JavaScript (ES6+):</h6> Utilized for DOM manipulation, asynchronous programming, and implementing the core currency conversion logic.
Currency API: Integrated an open-source Currency API to fetch real-time exchange rates.

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
The Currency Converter project showcases a practical application of web development concepts, providing users with a versatile and efficient tool for currency conversion. The addition of country flag 
displays adds a visual dimension to the user experience. The combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with the integration of modern web technologies, results in a seamless and responsive user experience.
